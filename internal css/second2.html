        Pandya played for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL from 2015 to 2021.[9][10] Against the Kolkata Knight Riders, in
        a must-win match for Mumbai Indians to remain in the playoff race, he scored 61 runs off 31 balls to take the
        match, earning him his second man of the match award of the 2015 season.[11] <br>
        Ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction, Pandya was released by the Mumbai Indians. He was then drafted by the new
        Ahmedabad-based franchise, Gujarat Titans, and named captain of the team.[12][13] He led Gujarat to their maiden
        IPL title in 2022, becoming the first captain after Shane Warne in 2008 to lead a team to the title in its first
        year.[14] In the IPL 2023 Pandya again led Gujarat Titans to their second consecutive final but lost to Chennai
        Super Kings by five wickets through DLS method.
